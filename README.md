Coffee Shop Challenge
Welcome to the Coffee Shop Challenge, a Python-based object relationships project designed to help you model and implement real-world data relationships in a simplified coffee shop scenario.

ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
In this challenge, you will model three core entities:

Coffee

Customer

Order

A Coffee has many Orders, a Customer has many Orders, and an Order belongs to both a Customer and a Coffee. This creates a many-to-many relationship between Coffee and Customer through the Order class.
